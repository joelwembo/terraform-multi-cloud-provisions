##Â Example: Running commands via WinRM on a Windows Virtual Machine

This example provisions a Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016 with a Public IP Address and [runs a `remote-exec` provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/remote-exec.html) via WinRM.

Notes:

- The files involved in this example are split out to make it easier to read, however all of the resources could be combined into a single file if needed.
- The certificate used for WinRM is generated by Azure KeyVault and then installed on the VM; as such the certificate in this example is self-signed, which may not be desirable in a real-world environment.
